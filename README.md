# ApacheJMeter_oauth
OAuth 1.0 Sampler for JMeter

This JAR implements a JMeter sampler called "OAuth Request".

It's based on HTTP Request with HTTPClient and supports OAuth signing.

To install the plugin, download the binary distribution of JMeter and copy the following files

    * target/lib/oauth-20100527.jar         on JMETER_HOME/lib
    * target/ApacheJMeter_oauth-v2.jar      on JMETER_HOME/lib/ext

This is only tested with JMeter 2.11.

Once correctly installed, you should see "OAuth Request" in sampler menu.
