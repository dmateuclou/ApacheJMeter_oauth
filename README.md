# ApacheJMeter_oauth
OAuth 1.0 Sampler for JMeter

This JAR implements a JMeter sampler called "OAuth Request".
It's based on HTTP Request with HTTPClient and supports
OAuth signing.

To install the plugin, download the binary distribution of
JMeter and copy the JAR file to lib/ext directory
under JMeter. This is only tested with JMeter 2.11

Once correctly installed, you should see "OAuth Request"
in sampler menu, right beneath "Mail Reader Sampler".
